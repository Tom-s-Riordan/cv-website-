            <p>I have widely varying levels of skill with the above programs and languages. Some I’ve been using for years and am highly proficient with,
               InDesign, IONOS, Final Cut Pro, Word and Final Draft, others I’ve used to augment already established skillsets as needs arose, Photoshop,
               After-Effects, Premiere, Creative Cloud, while the remaining list of programing languages… to call me a novice would be an insult to novices everywhere.
              I am, however, about one month into a three month coding bootcamp. I built this site with the knowledge I've been 
            able to gleem thusfar and I will get better with each passing day.</p>

                <p> Before leaving Los Angeles and relocating to the Pacific Northwest I led a slightly different life.
                I was a military advisor and CEO of R&R Tactical, an entrepreneur with eighteen years of hands
                on experience in media and entertainment. I'd been the Tech Advisor for over a hundred television episodics and
                worked with all major Studios on some of the largest and longest running television shows. </p>

           <p> I am a proud to be one of the four founding members of Pocket Watch Productions.  
            Pocket Watch Productions is dedicated to the kind of innovative storytelling that has made our industry the
            cultural leader in entertainment around the globe. Our team utilizes experience, creativity and a relentless
            pursuit of excellence to bring forward the best in film and television content.
            <br>
            Pocket Watch Productions is veteran-owned and veteran-operated. All founding members statisfy the criteria 
            to be considered disabled veterans and are proud of it. We believe in employing veterans from all branches of 
            the US military whenever possible. Many of the film and television projects currently
            under development with Pocket Watch Productions are stories of the bravery, dedication and resilience
            of the American armed forces – men and women whose true-life experiences deserve to be told to a wide
            audience.</p>

          <img class="circleltd" src="images/circleltd.png" alt="circ-lelogo">
          <p>The Circle has been my own private playground for many years. A place where projects that might not have been ready for mass consumption have found a home. 
            This includes several Short Films which were produced with little to no budget, just because.<br> It's my island of misfit ideas, stories with no hope and 
            maybe that was the point all along. There have been some minor successes along the way but most importantly, it's been a fun ride.
