        <p>
          A brutal, unflinching imagining of a war wherein both sides feel
          morally justified by religious belief. Any behavior, any tactic, no
          matter how blood thirsty or murderous is condoned by political and
          military leadership. The ultimate goal justifies the ultimate means.
          Through the eyes of a front line solider, this story is told. He
          struggles with the morality of war on behalf of God. These are the
          battles of revelation, the battle against the forces of the Antichrist
          but each side claims its opponent is that enemy. How could a standard
          issue solider know the truth? Could he be fighting on behalf of the
          Antichrist?

        <h2>Triple Nickles</h2>
        <h3>
          True story of bravery and resilience of the 555th all-Black Parachute
          Infantry Battalion.
        </h3>
        <p>
          During WWII, the Japanese began attaching incendiary bombs to hydrogen
          balloons and sending them across the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to
          wreak havoc on the infrastructure of the United States. During
          operation “Fu-Go” almost ten thousand of these bombs were launched,
          igniting hundreds of forest fires in the Pacific North West.<br />In
          an attempt to deceive the Japanese intelligence services, the United
          States opted to keep the cause of these fires classified, not publicly
          acknowledging the flames and suppressing media coverage. The goal
          being to convince the Japanese that their tactics were ineffective.
          The “Triple Nickels” were quietly deployed to fight the fires and
          become some of the first “Smoke Jumpers”. This top secret deployment
          was known as Operation Firefly. The 555th PIB were chosen for this
          mission, stems from segregation era policies and prejudices. As the
          only “colored” paratroopers, these men had been prevented from
          deploying to Eroupe or the Pacific Theater. Their war was here at
          home. Their war was amongst the flames.

        <h2>72Hrs To Kill.</h2>
        <p>
          Once a year, an underground gaming event takes place wherein a normal
          person is marked without thier knowledge. Then, the hunt begins.
          Unnamed, faceless assasians hunt that person, each vying for the
          coveted “kill” and the prize money that comes with it. While private
          viewing parties rage, overseen by the game’s creator LOS, millions are
          wagered on every imaginable outcome; the kill, the injuries, weapons,
          over/ under lines and even on the person’s survival.
